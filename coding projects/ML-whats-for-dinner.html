<div class="blurb">
	<p>This was an assignment completed in my Artificial Intelligence class. This assignment was the assignment during our machine learning unit. 
		The assignment objective was to guess which attribute was the most important in deciding where
    someone decided to eat for dinner. The algorithm was inputted a dataset with various information about the restaurant such as cousine type,
  day of the week, estimated wait time, number of patrons, and decision of if the person at there or not. 
  
  My code for this project is <a href="https://github.com/gabbiebolcer/gabbiebolcer.github.io/blob/master/DecisionTree.java">here</a></p>
