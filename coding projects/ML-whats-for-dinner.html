<div class="blurb">
	<p>This was an assignment completed in my Artificial Intelligence class during Spring 2021. This assignment was the assignment during our machine learning unit. 
		The assignment objective was to guess which attribute was the most important in deciding where
    someone decided to eat for dinner and make a decision tree explaining the choices for dinner. The algorithm was inputted a dataset with various information about the restaurant such as cousine type,
  day of the week, estimated wait time, number of patrons, and decision of if the person at there or not.
