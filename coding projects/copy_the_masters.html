<div class="blurb">
	<p>This was an assignment completed in my Data Communication and Visualizations class. For this assigment, we had to find a piece of data journalism 
  with some kind of data visualization in it. We then had to use ggplot2 to implement the best copy we could of the data visualization that the 
  author had included in their article.
