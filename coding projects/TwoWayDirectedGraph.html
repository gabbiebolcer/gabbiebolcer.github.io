title: Two Way Directed Graph
---
<br></br>
<div class="blurb">
	<p>This was an assignment completed in my Algorithms class during Fall 2021 to familiarize ourselves with two way directed graphs. In the assignment, the goal was to find a route to work
using the two way graph that consisted of one uphill and one downhill. The direction of the node was an attibute of each node in the graph. Once a solution was found, true was returned. This
	algorithm did not search for the most efficent route.\n
  My code for can be seen below.
