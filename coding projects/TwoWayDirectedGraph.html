title: Two Way Directed Graph
---
<div class="blurb">
	<p>This was an assignment completed in my Algorithms class to familiarize ourselves with two way directed graphs. In the assignment, the goal was to find a route to work
using the two way graph that consisted of one uphill and then one downhill. The direction of the graph let described if the area between the current node and the next
node was an uphill or downhill
  
  My code for this project is <a href="https://github.com/gabbiebolcer/gabbiebolcer.github.io/blob/master/TwoWayDirectedGraph.java">here</a></a></p>
