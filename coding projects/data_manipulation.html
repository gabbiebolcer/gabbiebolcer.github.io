<div class="blurb">
	<p>I completed this project in my Data Mining and Machine Learning class in Spring 2022. My partner and I were conducting data analysis on data where each day's worth 
    of data was split between different files. To successfully load the data into statistical software, we needed all of the data to be in one file. I created this Python
    script to select only the columns we were interested in and only a small number of rows so we didn't overload the statistical software when doing our analysis.
