## About Me:


  I am a Senior Computer Science and Data Analytics major at the University of St. Thomas. I have spent the last few years being quite busy finishing my degree, working 
  at my software engineering internship, and running on the cross country and track teams at St. Thomas. At work I enjoy getting data from one place to the next so 
  that the next team can do their fancy tricks on it. I love coding in Python and using AWS to solve data problems.
