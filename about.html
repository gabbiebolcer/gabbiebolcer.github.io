<div class="blurb">
	<p>I'm a Computer Science and Data Analytics major finishing up my degree at the University of St. Thomas this spring. I LOVE working in python (pandas is easily my 
  favorite package) and integrating with AWS. In my classes I have also used Java, Javascript, and C. 
    
    Outside of Coding I enjoy running and cross country skiing (I'll do pretty much anything active) and I love cooking.
    
    Here's a video with more about me
