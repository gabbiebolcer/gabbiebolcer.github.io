	In my final Theology class at the University of St. Thomas, I wrote a paper discussing how Algorithms affect human relationships. During this class I realized that this was a topic that I was very passionate about. As someone going to work in a tech field, I understand that I need to understand how what I'm building affects others. This could be understanding biases in what I build or, as this class showed me, understanding how something I build can change how people interact with one another and the effects that has on people's physical, emotional, and spiritual wellbeing. We briefly discussed the affects of biases in Algorithms in my computer science Capstone class, but in this essay I discussed some of the harmful effects algorithms have, even when they're working exactly how they are designed to be.
